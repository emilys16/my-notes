 The keyword "Make" was used in various [backgrounds](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/make_v1?tab=etymology&typeOfFormation=derivative) dating back to the 12th century and was initially inherited from the Germanic people. A prominent historical use of the verb was the Indo-European based word _maeddu_, which means 'to knead or work with the hands.' This is congruent with the modern use of the word, which is associated with creating things, whether it is art, cooking, baking, music, or pottery. The derivatives of make include making, made, and mend, frequently used in replacement for historical definitions.

The word make was also "denoting the form or condition of the created being or object, or the purpose of the object of creation." However, the word was still used to describe a creation, something that was made. For example, in his play _Henry VI_ in 1623, Shakespeare wrote, "This hand was made to handle nought but Gold."

Current uses of the word "make" include:
- Creation concept - for example, 'make plans.'
- Taking action - for example, 'make a choice.'
- Creative innovation - for example, 'make art.'
- Metaphors/linguistics - for example, 'make the best of it.'

The process and importance of the maker movement, as described by Kim Martin in [_Making Conversation: An Experiment in Public Digital Humanities_](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780776640068-010/html), is merging do-it-yourself personalities with technology and how the practice of making in its various forms has been around for centuries. Everyone, in their own way, is a _maker_; while not everyone is fond of arts and crafts, it does not define what it means to be a maker. Making is learning new skills and exchanging ways of doing things with a chosen community. The maker movement has sparked innovation and community-based collaboration to hands-on problem-solve.
