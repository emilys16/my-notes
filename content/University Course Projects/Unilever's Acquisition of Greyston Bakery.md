# Strategic Management Plan 
The strategic management process is a process that consists of strategic planning, implementation, and evaluation (Robbins et al., 2021, p.114). This process helps businesses to achieve their long-term goals using a series of steps.

The first step of the process will be to identify the vision, mission, and goals of Greyston and Ben & Jerry's. The vision and mission statement shows the organization's purpose (Robbins et al., 2021, p.114). For example, Greyston Bakery's mission statement is to "create meaningful job opportunities for those who have experienced barriers to employment; we hire our bakers through our renowned, inclusive Open Hiring policy. Then we provide our bakers with ongoing training and development to enrich their work experience" (Greyston, n.d.). Ben & Jerry's mission statement is to "make the world a better place. Guided by core values, every level of Ben & Jerry's works to advance human rights and dignity, support social and economic justice for marginalized communities, and protect and restore the Earth's natural systems" (Unilever, 2023). It is evident that both companies share a joint mission to create a more inclusive world. Since both organizations are aligned when integrated, they can also share the same vision.

The second and third steps of the process are to conduct an internal and external analysis of the two companies. The internal analysis provides insight into the company's capabilities and resources (Robbins et al., 2021, p.116). When conducting the internal analysis, Unilever will need to address the strengths and weaknesses of both companies and the strengths and weaknesses of integrating the companies. This can be done by identifying key areas such as financial performance, gathering data, and evaluating the performance of the data from the key areas. The external analysis provides insights into the external environment that the company is within (Robbins et al., 2021, p.116). When conducting the external analysis, Unilever will need to address the opportunities and threats to both companies to understand possible factors that may impact the integration and success of combining the companies. This can be done by examining industry trends, competition, and other environmental factors.

The fourth and fifth steps of the process are to formulate and implement strategies. Unilever will need to capitalize on strengths and exploit opportunities found during the internal and external analysis. Formulating strategies will give the company a competitive advantage (Robbins et al., 2021, p.118). For example, if there is a high demand for blondie ice cream, Unilever could exploit the opportunity and formulate a strategy to produce a new product in that flavour. To implement these strategies, Unilever must allocate resources and communicate with teams, like the distribution team, to release the product (Robbins et al., 2021, p.119).

# Structural Reorganization 
Structurally re-organizing an organization is a process that redesigns the existing structure to create a more effective and efficient system. Currently, Greyston Bakery only discloses its fiscal structure on the not-for-profit Greyston Foundation portion of its website (Greyston, n.d.). A few concepts to incorporate into the newly integrated organization structure include work specialization, departmentalization, the chain of command, the span of control, and formalization.

Work specialization would be good to incorporate into Greyston's re-organized structure because it will allow the bakery to use the diversity of skills each worker has to make the production process as efficient as possible (Robbins et al., 2021, p.132). For example, a team consisting of a baking specialist, packaging specialist, flavour specialist, and quality control specialist works more efficiently than a non-specialized team because the individual highly skilled workers create a more productive environment. Therefore, work specialization leads to Greyston Bakery having an increase in profit from the higher productivity.

Adding departmentalization in the restructure for Greyston would group jobs after work specialization to coordinate common tasks (Robbins et al., 2021, p.133). Using functional departmentalization would be more effective than product departmentalization since the primary focus of Greyston Bakery is only brownies. In addition, functional departmentalization would allow Greyston to group jobs by workers' specialization (Robbins et al., 2021, p.133). This will reduce the possibility of duplication and reduce costs. For example, the specialist that makes up the production team would be divided into smaller groups like baking, packaging, and mixing.

Further, the concept of chain of command, which affects all organizational levels, would help the flow of accountability, responsibility, and authority (Robbins et al., 2021, p.134). The chain of command ensures that every employee understands their roles, responsibilities, and management level within the business. It also ensures that everyone is held accountable by answering to their supervisors.

Span of control is an important aspect of an organization's structure because it determines how many people one person can manage. An effective use of span of control would be using small spans, typically no more than six employees (Robbins et al., 2021, p.138). For example, since Greyston Bakery is not as large of a company since it does not have any chain stores, small spans would be beneficial because when managers have a smaller group reporting to them, they can provide better individual guidance and feedback.

Finally, formalization helps standardize jobs, resulting in a uniform and consistent output. The formalization of a job would guide the employee's behaviour to abide by specific procedures and rules when making the brownies (Robbins et al., 2021, p.140). This behaviour is fundamental when baking, as each recipe and batch needs to be consistent. In addition, consistency is important when it comes to product quality control; this ensures the brownies are safe for consumption and maintains customer satisfaction.

# Leadership Model 
For Unilever's Greyston/Ben & Jerry's integration, the different levels of management will utilize three separate leadership models. These models are transformational leadership, situational leadership, and transactional. Different management levels must utilize different leadership styles due to their differing goals, priorities, and responsibilities.

Transformational leaders inspire and motivate employees to reach their full potential for the business's good (Robbins et al., 2021, p.286). Transformational leaders often have a significant impact on their employees; thus, the top level of leadership would benefit from this model. Transformational leadership has the element of intellectual stimulation, which challenges employees to think critically and creatively. This leadership style also has the element of inspirational motivation, which motivates employees to reach their goals and increase growth. These elements effectively support that top management and transformational leaders both aim to define the values and policies that affect the organization's members (Robbins et al., 2021, p.7).

Middle management would benefit from situational leadership. Situational leaders are leaders that focus on matching the needs and behaviours of their employees to ensure readiness to take on tasks (Robbins et al., 2021, p.280). The element of flexibility allows situational leaders to adapt their style to the situation. The communication element allows them to effectively understand their employees' needs and provide the appropriate guidance. Middle management and situational leadership are both responsible for translating goals and managing others (Robbins et al., 2021, p.8).

Supervisory or first-line managers would benefit from transactional leadership. Transactional leaders guide employees using social exchanges to establish goals and rewarding for meeting those goals (Robbins et al., 2021, p.280). The element of goal setting allows transactional leaders to define expectations for employees and help them stay focused clearly. The element of feedback helps transactional leaders help employees improve performance. These elements effectively support that first-line management and transactional leadership both monitor employees' performance, especially on a day-to-day basis (Robbins et al., 2021, p.8).

# Operations Control Plan
Operations management is essential to ensure that Unilever integration can effectively control and manage the production of goods. (Robbins et al., 2021, p.358). The operations system must be managed effectively to produce the final brownie product successfully. Operations control focuses on several essential priorities: quality, delivery, and service.

For operations to stay under control, Unilever must focus on production quality. Currently Greyston Bakery only discloses from their operations process that the brownies are made with the finest ingredients, no preservatives, and love (Greyston, n.d.). To exceed customers' expectations of Greyston's brownies, quality control measures of testing and inspections to detect any possible issues, as well as using new technologies to improve the production process continuously.

Delivery in operations control refers to efficient and timely product delivery to consumers. This will increase customer satisfaction by ensuring all the brownies are made fast and fresh. In addition, delivery will involve closer monitoring of the supply chain to gain information on delivery times and costs to get the product out with minimal costs and disruptions.

Operations control service will help better assist customers with their purchases. Training the employees on up-to-date customer service practices, standards, and procedures will be beneficial to exceed customers' needs. Customer satisfaction is important to any business to build customer loyalty, reputation, and sales revenue.

# Managerial Control Plan 
Top management at Greyston Bakery can use the managerial control levers of feedforward, concurrent, and feedback control to put the corrections in place and keep production on track.

Greyston can use feedforward control to anticipate potential issues before the problem occurs (Robbins et al., 2021, p.337). For example, feedforward control is used when providing safety training to new employees. Training new employees to use the ovens, machinery, and other baking-related activities avoids potential accidents or injuries like cuts or burns.

Greyston can use concurrent control while completing a task (Robbins et al., 2021, p.338). For example, concurrent control is used for customer service and inventory maintenance. Customer services involve monitoring interactions in real-time, ensuring quality service. This is a great way to measure customer satisfaction. Inventory maintenance is an important concurrent task because it ensures there is a sufficient stock of ingredients to make the brownies.

Feedback control can be used after completing the task (Robbins et al., 2021, p.338). For example, Greyston can use feedback when giving performance reviews to employees. Performance reviews can help employees improve and better prioritize, as well it helps employees learn what their strengths are and skills that need further development.
