# Data Source
The historical dataset of The Book of Negroes comes from the real historical document created in 1783 following the War of Independence (Nova Scotia, 2022). The document was compiled by British military officials under the command of Commander-in-Chief Sir Guy Carleton for the purpose of registering and identifying the Black Loyalists who were eligible to evacuate New York to Nova Scotia (Library and Archives Canada, 2019). The action of recording each person and proof of service prevented people from posing as Black Loyalists as only those who has served in the British Army or who had a certificate of freedom were to be rewarded with relocation and land.

# Dataset Structure/ Categories of Information 
The data that was recorded in The Book of Negroes included name, age, gender, physical characteristics, occupation, military identification, place of origin, legal status, names of former owners, destination, and ship of passage. The records show that recording the former master of the slave “it was to be used to compensate slave owners in the event that the evacuation was later found to contravene the treaty” (Library and Archives Canada, 2019). This shows a continuation of controlling these people’s lives even though these people were free, which reinforces a system where ownership was still central to one’s identity. The descriptions suggested that they were seen an economic asset or potential liability, rather than free people and still viewed in a racial and colonial hierarchy.

# Present Day Recontextualization 
The original document of The Book of Negroes has been digitized and made public access by the Government of Canada Library and Archives. In addition to the archived document there are historical letters and fictional literature to recontextualize from. The digitized version makes the dataset more accessible for researchers, historians, and institutions interpretation. Reading the historic fiction, The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill, changed my interpretation of the historic event. I was able to learn in a first-person perspective and emotionally engage in the broader historical context. The theme of the novel allows readers to reflect on the continued injustice and its influence on contemporary society.

# Cultural and Political Discourse 
The Book of Negroes is relevant to current cultural and political discourse because it touches on freedom, systemic racism, migration, and power dynamics. The dataset is a reminder of how power can shape the lives of marginalized communities and illustrates how this dynamic further negatively impacted systemic racism. This notion aligns with modern day issues of equity and equality still happening in education and in the workplace. Further, the dataset emphasizes forced migration and resettlement. In today’s political climate there are a large number of refugees and displaced populations seeking freedom from the ongoing wars on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. The dataset demonstrated the importance of being ethical and serves as a cautionary tale about the wrongful use of power dynamics when treating people and collecting data.
