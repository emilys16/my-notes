# External Situational Analysis
## Macro Environment
### Economic
The growth of Canada’s GDP has huge economic relevance for a plethora of business industries. A growing GDP is an indication of economic prosperity throughout a country. The GDP of Canada has grown steadily over the last four economic quarters. In the three-month quarter leading up to June of 2022, the GDP rose by a margin of 0.8%. (Trading Economics, 2022). This figure equalizes the growth rate from the previous period and marks four sectors of consecutive growth (See Exhibit A, Economic Force 1). Growth in GDP affects consumers, positively, in a major way. GDP growth proliferates job opportunities, which in turn, creates a stream of revenue for many individuals. This leaves consumers with an increased amount of disposable income, for example (See Exhibit A, Economic Force 1). For many, a significant portion of their disposable income goes into the apparel industry, teens reportedly spend 38% of their earnings in the apparel industry, and the average family spends about 3.8% of their total income on apparel. (Yaqub M, 2022). Canada's overall GDP took a major hit due to the 2020 pandemic, for example (See Exhibit A, Economic Force 1). Canada’s per capita GDP during 2020-2021 experienced a decrease of 1.3% per year, (Wang, 2022). The lifting of public health restrictions gave the ability for Canada’s GDP to return to prosperous ways. The long-term effect of the GDP on the apparel industry is unpredictable, for the reason that GDP change is unpredictable long-term. In the short term, the recent growth in Canada’s GDP is undoubtedly a benefit towards something like the apparel industry.
### Technology
In 2018 there were 24 million individual social media users in Canada, that number is predicted to rise to 39 million by 2027 (Dixon, 2022). With growth like that it’s only natural that social media has an important impact on the fashion industry. This is one of many examples of how technology plays a very important role in the fashion industry as a whole.
### Political Legal
Political/Legal forces can be challenging for suppliers and consumers. These forces are implied in many ways. Political factors are the larger, more outside the box factors such as taxes, tariffs, and trade policies. Legal factors tend to be straight to the point with things such as discrimination laws, antitrust laws, or even property laws (Galloway, 2022). All these factors come into effect in the apparel industry, in more ways than you might know.
### Socio-cultural
Social-cultural forces determine if the product meets the customer’s needs based on the consumer’s lifestyle. The fashion and apparel retail industry manufacture and distributes clothing to various retailers and produces multiple marketing strategies (Steele, 2022). These different sectors of the fashion/ apparel industry are affected by sociocultural forces.

## Industry Analysis
### Description 
The fashion retail industry is a section of the retail industry that acts as an intermediary between manufacturers and customers (Berlinsbi, 2019). The apparel industry has a calculated global market revenue of around $1.5 trillion USD in 2021 (Smith, 2022). With the rise in technology, fashion companies can now reach a global audience and are no longer restricted to brick-and-mortar storefronts; now, almost all fashion companies have online storefronts, social media engagement, and a variety of digital promotions (Fashion Gone Rogue, 2022). Due to the industry's growth, most companies supply their materials from third-world countries to keep up with fast fashion and the ever-changing clothing trends (Bush, 2016). The industry's direct buyers are wholesalers, retailers, and the average customer (Kiron, 2021).
### Industry Structure
The fashion retail industry is an example of a monopolistic competition market structure. A monopolistic competition market structure consists of many sellers selling slightly different products that serve the same purpose (i.e., clothing) while having only minor trade barriers. Minor trade barriers allow smaller fashion retail companies to enter the global market and make products less expensive (Edubirdie, 2021). Each company within the fashion industry differentiates itself based on its product design, price, packaging, and marketing strategies (Kopp, 2021).
### Size and Growth Rate, Current and Projected 
By examining Aritzia’s previous annual reports it is evident that the company top line sales are declining. Analyzing Aritzia’s net revenue from 2018 to 2019 the percentage change increased 17.63% signaling growth in 2019 (Aritzia, 2019). When looking at 2019 to 2020 the percentage change increased only by 12.16%; thus, Aritzia was growing at a slower rate (Aritzia, 2020). Finally, when comparing the 2020 and 2021 annuals reports, there was a –12.57% change in growth, showing a decline in the top line from the previous year.  

Moreover, Aritzia is experiencing a fluctuation in the profit growth rates. Comparing the percentage change for 2018 to 2019 and the percentage change for 2020 to 2019, it is evident that Aritzia was growing at a faster rate as it went from 16.05% profit growth to 17.65% profit growth. The fluctuation occurs between 2021 to 2020 as there is a –22.54% decline in profit growth (Aritzia, 2021); thus, showing a decline in the company's growth. To conclude, when examining Aritzia's top line and bottom line, it is apparent that Aritzia is not currently growing. In the future Aritzia has projected that if the asset turnover ratio does not increase the company will continue to decline and undersell. Further, the apparel industry is expected to grow by 59.2% between 2021 and 2025 amounting to over $1.1 trillion CAD (Key drivers for growth in the global online apparel market, 2022). This means that over $753 million CAD of clothing could be sold per day over the course of the projected 4 years.

### Porter's 5 Forces
**Threat of Entrants** 
The threat of new entry to Aritzia is low because of the time and financial investment required to create a brand or store at the level of Aritzia. The three largest competitors of Aritzia are Zara, Urban Outfitters and American Eagle (Semrush, 2022).  This lineup of brands has an established history; notably, no new start-ups compete closely with Aritzia, showing the difficulty of creating a new competitor.   

**Threat of Substitutes**  
The availability of substitutes for Aritzia is low. This is because there is no substitute for clothing, Aritzia's product. Competitive rivalry covers substitutes for Aritzia as a brand; thus, we will look at substitutes for clothing retailers, such as thrift stores. 83% of Canadians said that they shopped at a thrift store in 2020 (Tighe, 2022), an increase from 2019; however, this increase had no adverse effect on Aritzia. Aritzia reported an increase in sales from 2019 to 2020 (Aritzia, 2020), showing that it is not likely that thrift stores are competing much with Aritzia.   

**Bargaining Power of Buyers** 
The buyer power in the apparel industry is high. Buyers have the bargaining power to start pushing down prices, not buying products, or even switching up their retailers and buying other brands (see exhibit B). When consumers shop for an apparel item, they have all the power to exit the store and start buying from other sources (Smith, 2022). This leads to high buyer power and even little incentives for the consumer to continue buying and shopping for your brand. (Smith, 2022).  

**Bargaining Power of Suppliers** 
The supplier power in the clothing industry is low. Therefore, when a company no longer likes the price/product the supplier is providing, it is easy for them to switch out their main suppliers (see exhibit B). This means that companies would choose a cheaper option, such as third-world countries, allowing to give up a smaller percentage of profit (Smith, 2022). Further, the input prices of the industry will be low and continue to stay this way until the global development gap closes significantly (Smith, 2022).  

**Competitive Rivalry Within the Industry** 
Competitive rivalry in the apparel industry is a medium force. It is medium due to most items in the apparel industry being differentiated (see exhibit B). Large companies compete for market share while the smaller companies just entering the industry compete (Smith, 2022). Therefore, the competitive rivalry is medium because each company competes differently for market share.

### Supply Chain (Flow of Product)
In the apparel industry, a company's supply chain begins at the design stage, finalizing the garments shape, colour, texture, and outline before moving onto the next step of the supply chain (see exhibit C). The design then moves to identifying which raw materials to use for the garment and then obtaining and outsource the farming of raw materials from the supplier. Next the textiles are sold and delivered to manufacturers in other countries to be produced. Following clothing production is the shipping process from the foreign manufacturer to the North American retailer. From this point, the apparel merchandise will be either delivered to retail locations or sold to customers via e-commerce websites

## Competitive Anlaysis
### Key Competitors & Success, Share of Market & Projected Growth
There are a wide variety of factors that contribute to success in the apparel industry, however, the most pivotal factors for success are advertising, technology, and understanding your customers. Advertising is essential for raising awareness of your brand's products and conveying your message. To stay competitive companies such as Aritzia, Zara, and Lululemon explore various new and trendy advertising styles, for example using celebrities and influencers to market their product (Component 2- Key Factors for Success). Additionally, using technology to aid in selling your product is advantageous to a company's success in the apparel industry. In 2020, 80% of Canadians shopped online (Component 1- Technological forces), therefore using innovative and easy-to-use technology benefits a company's sales. Finally, a key factor for success is understanding your customer's wants and needs. An example of this is how customers are interested in purchasing sustainable clothing that will last multiple seasons as opposed to cheaply made clothing (Component 1- Socio-Cultural forces). Understanding facts like these about your demographic can help you cater to customers' needs and in turn increase sales.

# Internal Situational Analysis
## Strategic Overview
### Company Description 
Aritzia is a company that sells women's apparel, offering trendy and fashionable clothes for women ages 15-35. Their luxury brand catches the eyes of many shoppers and allows women to feel special when wearing the Aritzia brand. Aritzia delivers “everyday luxury through engaging service, beautiful products, aspirational environments and captivating communications” (Aritzia Report, 2022). They sell a variety of clothing and apparel items that one can choose from (see chart #1 below). In the 2021 fiscal year, Aritzia brought in a net revenue of 267.5 million dollars (Aritzia Report, 2022). As of 2021, there are 101 Aritzia locations, 68 of them being in Canada and the remainder being in the United States of America (Sabanoglu, 2021). Aritzia as of 2022 has 6,569 employees (Datanyze, 2022). Aritzia divides their company into different management groups. They use the traditional hierarchy system, meaning that the top of the management is the CEO and founder of Aritzia. The CPO, CFO, CIO and the Executive Vice President all report to the CEO, and then under all those high roles is a variety of business partners and directors that all the department managers and informational management staff will report to. In Aritzia’s case, the CEO is the “face” of the company, and everything is run through him first as he is responsible for all the organization and management of the business.

### Strategic Plan/ Focus
**Mission/Vision** 
Our vision is to be the most relevant and loved fashion destination for women all over the world. We believe in fashion that inspires and is both beautiful and beautifully made. We create aspirational environments and experiences, offer personalized and engaging service that delights, and engage through captivating communications. We call this Everyday Luxury.

**Organizational Culture** 
“Organizational culture refers to a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that show employees what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior” (Chatman & Eunyoung, 2003; Kerr & Slocum Jr., 2005). Organizational culture values influence employee performance and behaviour. The organizational culture in Aritzia is mixed depending on the source's hierarchy in the company and/or retail experience. As mentioned in an article for Forbes, the president and COO Jennifer Wong says that Aritzia grows their employees career path by “championing, supporting, and growing women in leadership and across all levels of our organization is core to our beliefs” (See Exhibit E, Aritzia leads with empathy) (Eldor, 2021). While the company preaches positivity with their sustainability and ethical sourcing, the treatment of their employees is a stark contrast. On employee review websites such as Glassdoor and Indeed, the majority of Aritzia retail employees are unsatisfied by their work experience at the clothing store. A main conflict with former employees is that they did not feel appreciated. One former employee said, “The thing that made me leave was how executives treat staff and leadership. It is embedded in culture to not say hi to everyone unless they are ‘your level’” (See Exhibit E, Employees do not feel appreciated) indeed, 2022). When employees do not feel appreciated, they feel as though they do not belong which can cause tension in the workplace. A toxic work environment causes several challenges including high stress levels, which can affect mental and physical health (BetterHelp Editorial Team, 2022). Lastly, Aritzia has a competitive environment. Aritzia’s scheduling is based on performance, therefore, the more you sell the more hours you get (See Exhibit E, Competitive). Typically, performance-based scheduling can be difficult for new employees and can lead to conflict and hierarchy within the staff. Due to the abundant negative experiences from former employee Aritzia does not have a positive organizational culture

**Organizational Structure** 
Aritzia uses a traditional functional departmentalization organizational structure. This means that the company is headed by the CEO, Jennifer Wong, who works in tandem with the bord of directors headed by Founder and Executive Chair, Brian Hill. The CEO is reported to by the other executives, in this case the CFO, Todd Ingledew, the CPCO, Karen Kwan, the CIO, Dave MacIver, and the Executive Vice President, Pippa Morgen. Each of these executives leads a different branch of Aritzia’s system, meaning that Aritzia uses a functional departmentalization structure, and leads a group of senior directors, directors, and lower-level staff, creating a pyramid characteristic of traditional organizational structures. This organizational structure makes sense because it allows Aritzia to focus on their various mission statements simultaneously. With a broad mission statement along with a plethora of environmental and ethical goals, it makes sense to divide Aritzia’s employees into groups focused on completing each of these different goals. Aritzia claims to be reaching their goals in their 2022 annual report so I would say that their organizational structure is working out correctly for them (Aritzia, 2022).

**Core Values** 
Aritzia has 6 core values that consist of loyalty, creativity, teamwork, good judgement, excellence and sustainability.

### Key Questions About Aritzia
**What Business Are They In?** 
Aritzia is in the apparel industry and do business to consumers with the intent of selling innovative and luxurious clothing with high quality products. 

**What Products Do We Provide?**
See Exhibit E, Product List 

**Key Factors for Success, Competitors, Resources and**  
Aritzia's factors for success can be compared to its direct competitors by their advertising strategies and their strengths. This drives up demand for that 1 product and quickly becomes a trend (Eldor, 2022). Quite the opposite, Zara is more unique and does not use celebrities to promote products but remains successful. Zara remains successful because it is known more globally, therefore, using celebrities is not as necessary. Urban outfitters advertising strategies are like Aritzia. Using influencers to promote products is a wonderful way to convince consumers that they should buy that product. Lululemon's advertising strategies are in between the 3 others. Lululemon uses fitness influencers rather than celebrities. Most of these fitness influencers are less popular than celebrities that the other companies use, but consumers can relate to them and see the use of fitness influencers as a more realistic and appropriate way to promote fitness clothing. In terms of comparing their strengths, Aritzia focuses on superior quality clothing (Eldor, 2022). In comparison, Zara is strong in keeping up with fast-changing trends and keeping their supply chain efficient (The Secret of Zara’s Success, 2021). High quality and efficient supply chains contribute equally to both companies' success. Aritzia's high quality is what keeps consumers coming back and reassures them that they are getting their money's worth. Urban outfitters strengths are mostly their choice in working with brand partners (Mcl, 2019). They work with other brands to create sustainable and legal changes globally (Brand Partnerships, 2022). From a consumer's perspective, Urban Outfitters cares about social issues in other countries and making a difference. This is a key factor in a consumer's decision to shop at a certain store. Aritzia’s last competitor Lululemon, showed a strong increase in brand recognition over the past 2 years (Diao, 2021). They became exceptionally good at researching their demographics and changing their inventory accordingly. This increased their market value by 40% (Medium, 2022). Each of these companies has different advertising strategies and strengths, but still compete aggressively against Aritzia. The competitive point of difference from Aritzia and its direct competitors would be that Aritzia’s clothes are trending right now for girls ages 14-30. With biker shorts and super puff jackets in style, majority of women hop on that trend and shop at Aritzia, especially after seeing influencers posting in these products.

## Financial Overview
### Market Capitalization/ Recent Stock Values and Returns
The size of Aritzia can be determined by the total dollar sales, market capitalization, number of shares outstanding, majority shareholders, past performance, and future financial targets. In Aritzia's total dollar sales, the company has $857,323 (See Exhibit B, Income Statement). Aritzia's market capitalization is $5,873,977.55. This is calculated by current stock price ($53.65) x total number of outstanding shares (109,487). This means that $5,873,977.55 is the value of the company that is traded in the stock market. (Annual report). Aritzia's major shareholders consist of the CEO Brian Hill, who is the largest shareholder with a 20% stake, FMR LLC with a 10% stake, and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation with a 5.3% stake (Yahoo!, 2021). In terms of Aritzia's past performance, they successfully adjusted to the pandemic and expanded their eCommerce. As stated in the annual report, Aritzia successfully navigated COVID to date, and prioritized the health and safety of clients (Aritzia, 2021). This helped increase revenues and please consumers. Ecommerce also grew by 88.3% and made up 49.4% of net revenues (Aritzia, 2021). Aritzia successfully managed to expand eCommerce when the pandemic hit. Aritzia's future financial target is to deliver net revenue growth of approximately 110%, with a target of approximately $234 million (Aritzia, 2021). Aritzia is a large company in North America, with ecommerce contributing to that result.

### Financial Health Assessment
**Profitability Ratios**
Profitability ratios tell how much profit a company has made in comparison to how much was invested and sold in the business. These ratios consist of Return on Equity, Return on Sales (Profit), and Earnings per share (EPS). Return on Equity is how good a company generates returns on investments that they have made.  Aritzia's Return on Equity is currently 0.05 (5%), below the industry benchmark of 29.7%, and below the range of 15%-20%, which is not good. Return on sales is how well a company can turn sales into profit. Aritzia's return on sales is about 0.06 (6%) (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis), which is below the industry benchmark of 9.6%, but in range of 5-10%. Earnings per share indicates how much money a business makes per share of stock. Aritzia's earning per share ratio is 0.18 or 18% (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis). This is considered a good earning per share as mentioned before, the higher the better. The EPS in the industry average in 2021 is 18.6% (CSIMarket, 2021), and any ratio over 15% is considered good.

**Liquidity ratios** 
Aritzia’s current ratio, which shows how capable they are of paying short-term debts, was equal to 1.43 in 2021 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis). Greater than 1 is good, and Aritzia ratio is around the industry average of 1.46 (ReadyRatios, 2022). The debt-to-equity ratio shows how well a company can pay long term debt. Ratios of 2 to 2.5 is good and Aritzia ratio is 2.17 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis). The industry average is lower at 1.66 (ReadyRatios, 2022). Working capital shows how much money is available to meet current financial obligations. Aritzia is $106,146CAD which is good if its above zero (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis). There is no information on the industry average. The age of receivables is the number of days it takes customers to pay back their bills. Aritzia had an age of receivables of 7.24 days in 2021 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis), which was slowed down from 5.93 days in 2020 (Aritzia, 2021). The age of receivables average in the retail industry was 5.10 days in Q2 of 2022 (Fisher, 2022). The age of inventory is the number of days it takes to sell all the inventory stored. Aritzia had an age of inventory of 115.11 days in 2021 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis), up significantly from 59.47 days in 2020 (Aritzia, 2021). The average age of inventory in the retail industry was 33.61 days in 2021 (Tarver, 2022). The age of payables is the number of days it takes to pay the company’s bills. Aritzia had an age of payables of 88.36 days in 2021 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis), which was more than double that of 2020’s number, 36.50 days (Aritzia, 2021). Around 45 days is ideal, so Aritzia is not doing well in this ratio.

**Stability Ratios** 
Aritzia’s inventory turnover for fiscal 2021 sits at approximately 3.17 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis). The time period used for Aritzia’s inventory was 12 months since the data used was a representation of their fiscal 2021 year. The average inventory turnover for the apparel industry is 3.91, meaning Aritzia is below the average (Scilly, M. 2016). However, any figure between 2 and 4 is considered ideal in the apparel industry meaning that Aritzia is within the healthy range, (Chalberg, M. 2019). Aritzia’s asset turnover for fiscal 2021 was 0.75 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis). Aritzia’s asset turnover for fiscal 2020 was roughly 0.95 (Aritzia 2020 annual report. 2020). The industry average for asset turnover is 1.68, meaning that Aritzia is well below the average (CSIMarket. 2022). Furthermore, an asset turnover ratio of 2.5 or greater is considered good for the retail industry, showing that Aritzia is underselling. Aritzia is inefficiently using its assets to produce sales. Aritzia’s receivables turnover ratio for fiscal 2021 was approximately 138.23 (See Exhibit C, Ratio Analysis).  Aritzia’s receivables turnover in 2020 was 112.56 (The Wall Street Journal, 2022). The average receivables turnover ratio in the apparel industry was 17.62 (HighRadius, 2022). Aritzia is well above this figure due to its low accounts receivable amount in comparison to its sales.

**Growth Ratios** 
By examining Aritzia’s previous annual reports it is evident that the company top line sales are declining.  When looking at 2019 to 2020 the percentage change increased only by 12.16% (See Exhibit D, Top Line) (Aritzia, 2020). Finally, when comparing the 2020 and 2021 annuals reports, there was a –12.57% change in growth, showing a decline in the top line from the previous year (See Exhibit D, Top Line). Moreover, Aritzia is experiencing a fluctuation in the profit growth rates. Comparing the percentage change for 2018 to 2019 and the percentage change for 2020 to 2019, it is evident that Aritzia was growing at a faster rate as it went from 16.05% profit growth to 17.65% profit growth (See Exhibit D, Bottom Line). The fluctuation occurs between 2021 to 2020 as there is a –22.54% decline in profit growth (See Exhibit D, Bottom Line) (Aritzia, 2021); thus, showing a decline in the company's growth. To conclude, when examining Aritzia's top line and bottom line, it is apparent that Aritzia is not currently growing.

# S.W.O.T. Analysis
## Internal Assessment
### Strengths
Aritzia has many strengths, but the most prominent of these is Aritzia’s understanding of key target demographics and the application of this understanding (See Exhibit F, Strength 1). Aritzia used this understanding of their customer demographics to increase their market value by 40% in 2022. This increase in market value was reflected in Aritzia’s revenue, with revenue earned in the 2023 fiscal year expected to surpass the 2022 fiscal year by approximately 50% (See Exhibit F, Strength 2). This means Aritzia has a clear image of where to expand its target audience and can implement more effective marketing campaigns when necessary.

### Weaknesses
Although Aritzia has shown that it has established itself as a successful company with many stores around North America, it still has some obvious weaknesses. To start things off, many employees do not feel satisfied with working for Aritzia as a company, and do not take pride in the brand (See Exhibit F Weakness 1). The workers and employees being unsatisfied leads to Aritzia’s second weakness, which is the employees not feeling like they are a part of the company and creating some tension within the workplace (See Exhibit F Weakness 2). This affects the company negatively because if the workers do not feel like they are a part of the company, then the amount of work they do and the level at which the work gets done starts to become lower. As stated earlier, Aritzia is known for having competitive hours in the workplace, which causes many major weaknesses (See Exhibit F Weakness 3). This means that when Aritzia employees are working, in order to get more hours, they need to sell more and make more for the company. Although this may seem like a good thing at first sight, it can cause a lot of discrepancies between employees.

## External Assessment
### Opportunities 
Aritzia can utilize many opportunities in the economy to increase profits, recognition, growth etc., but the most important opportunity that Aritzia can use to its advantage is the increasing demand for outdoor athletic wear (See Exhibit F, Opportunity 1). This is an especially important opportunity because Aritzia can use this information to change products in their store. Studies show that “The U.S. market for athleticwear is expected to grow to 69.2 billion in 2023, up from 54.3 billion in 2015. This will account for 36% of athletic apparel sales worldwide as more brands operating in the U.S. push to offer athletic clothing.” (Component 1, Economic Forces 4). Not only does this mean that consumers will be buying more athletic wear, but Aritzia will also continue to expand in the US market. The increase in demand plus the attraction of deals will increase capital altogether. Based on this information, Aritzia can also expand more in the US to increase sales. Overall, this huge opportunity could contribute to Aritza's growth by creating a change in products, using more marketing strategies, expanding more into the US, and increasing menswear.

### Threats
Aritzia as a company as well as the industry has many threats. The most significant threat Aritzia must face is that domestic prices will increase due to the increase in import prices (See Exhibit F, Threat 1) as well the costs of importing can be high for high quality materials (See Exhibit F, Threat 2). Due to Aritzia importing higher quality fabrics and materials this will cause profit loss if Aritzia does not raise the price of their clothing. As the cost of production rises the domestic price of the clothing will too. The rise in price will deter consumers from buying Aritzia’s product, causing a decrease in profit. In order to combat this threat, Aritzia can import less of the materials used to produce its products and source more materials domestically.
