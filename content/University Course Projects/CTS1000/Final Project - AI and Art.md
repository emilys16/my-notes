|Well some of the worlds biggest bands are speaking out against artificial intelligence. Musicians, actors, and authors have signed a protest letter against AI's use of their work... The Bank of Canada says there is a lot of uncertainty around how artificial intelligence could effect the economy moving forward... its not to say that there is not great potential in them, we cannot being this; its stealing peoples work... We are talking right now about artificial intelligence or AI, its becoming more prevalent throughout our society, and some people are concerned about the effects that it could have on multiple jobs. Especially those with more creative jobs such as artists and writers who worry that these AI tools could completely replace them and their need for their skill.|Various News clips from CTV, Global News, and Erie News Now (CTV, 2024) (Global News, 2023) (Erie News Now, 2023).|
|Welcome to my living room. Today's video essay will discuss how can AI be used ethically and as a collaborative tool in the creative process without diminishing the role of human artistic expression and authorship?<br><br>  <br><br>First lets start off with what exactly is AI and how it came to be so prevalent today.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|

|"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns" (Coursera Staff, 2024). AI encompasses a variety of technology including natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. This technology is possible through the AI models learning using algorithms trained on datasets.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|The most common examples of AI today are ChatGPT, smart assistants, google translate, autonomous vehicles, and social media dynamic algorithms|Person is on their phone using google maps, chatbot, and in a self-driving car.|
|Artificial intelligence has become prevalent across many industries by automating tasks to save money and time. With the increase in accessibilty of these AI tools it has become an essential skill for the workforce. I myself am signed up to do a AI ethics and productivity webinar this December.|Office setting|
|The creative process can look different for every artist and the creative process tends to be chaotic and nonlinear (Gregoire, 2019). Although there is no formula, Carolyn Gregoire describes the four most popular stages that can take place in the creative process.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|Stage 1 is preparation. This stage is gathering information and materials to identify sources of inspiration.|Title image that says "Stage 1: Preparation"|
|Stage 2 is incubation. This stage is when all those ideas marinate and create new connections.|Title image that says "Stage 2: Incubation"|
|Stage 3 is illumination. This is the aha moment when the ideas come together to form a creative breakthrough as a solution to your creative problem.|Title image that says "Stage 3: Illumination"|
|Stage 4 is verification. This is where the vision is put to paper, and the making starts, the idea is fleshed out and developed.|Title image that says "Stage 4: Verification"|
|Lastly this topic of AI and art focuses around the keyword of "make" which is "to produce (a material thing) by combination of parts, or by giving a certain form to a portion of matter, to manufacture; to construct, assemble, frame, fashion (OED, 2024).|Title image of the Oxford English Dictionary definition on "make."|
|Now that your all caught up, lets go back to the first comparison image I briefly showed you.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|Take Greg Rutkowski, a renowned Polish artist known for his stunning fantasy landscapes. His unique style has captivated audiences worldwide. Unfortunately, his work has also been exploited. He has been struggling with AI illegally using this art to train its programs (Heikkila, 2022).|Image comparing Greg Rutkowski's work to an AI prompt of his work|
|Melissa Heikkila says that "His distinctive style is now one of the most commonly used prompts in the new open-source AI art generator Stable Diffusion"<br><br>  <br><br>This is not an isolated incident. Many artists have found their works used without permission to train AI systems. If you’re an artist, you can check if your work has been stolen at websites like [HaveIBeenTrained.com](http://haveibeentrained.com/)|Home page of HaveIBeenTrained website andImages of Greg Rutkowski's portfolio work (Rutkowski, 2024).|
|The harm doesn’t stop at art theft. The rise of AI-generated content threatens to dampen creative ambition. Why hire an artist when you can generate an image in seconds? This puts artists and photographers at risk of losing income and devalues their craft.<br><br>  <br><br>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the creative world, but not without controversy. For many artists, AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a threat to their livelihoods and creative rights.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|Quote that I think perfectly encapsulates this is from Karle Sharro who said "Humans doing the hard jobs on minimum wage while the robots write poetry and paint is not the future I wanted" (Lapa, 2023)|Twitter screenshot of the quote "Humans doing the hard jobs on minimum wage while the robots write poetry and paint is not the future I wanted"|
|So, how are artists fighting back? Some are turning to tools like Nightshade, a program that subtly distorts digital images in ways that confuse AI training models. This helps protect their work from being exploited.|Examples of images generated by Nightshade-poisoned AI models and the clean AI model.<br><br>_Glaze and Nightshade team at University of Chicago_|
|Artists are reclaiming their creative rights, defending their originality in an era of AI. The future of art depends on ensuring that technology enhances creativity without replacing or exploiting those who make it possible.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|But if its so bad... then why are people still using it. People will use AI whether you like it or not. It is your job to learn how to learn to use them ethically.<br><br>  <br><br>AI has brought a new dimension to the creative process, transforming how artists, musicians, and writers approach their work. However, using AI ethically and authentically is key to ensuring it enhances, rather than diminishes, creativity (Fortino, 2023).<br><br>  <br><br>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has become a significant part of many industries. But what does it mean for creativity? AI is not just a tool for efficiency; it’s reshaping the creative process across various fields.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|Let’s explore that<br><br>Traditionally, creativity has been viewed as a deeply personal and intuitive process. An artist’s work often comes from their unique experiences and ideas. However, AI introduces new ways to support and enhance this process.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|In fields like visual art, AI can generate ideas, suggest color palettes, or even create entirely new forms of art based on input data. Artists are no longer making art alone but interacting with AI systems that can inspire and challenge their creativity. In fact, 65% of artists have used text-to-image AI tools to brainstorm new ideas (Shalwa, 2024).|Visual artist making a painting|
|In music, musicians use AI to analyze patterns, generate melodies, or remix existing tracks. These tools don’t replace human creativity but offer new perspectives and possibilities.|Musicians and producer recording a song in a studio|
|For writers, AI tools assist with making drafts, generating ideas, and even refining language. The writer still controls the narrative and tone, but AI can streamline the process or suggest unexpected directions. AI can also help writers overcome a creative block and spark fresh ideas.|A writer typing on a typewriter and holding up a finished piece of paper.|
|As Hutson states, “The artist is no longer a solitary genius but a collaborator" (Hutson, 2023) This shift doesn’t diminish the role of the creator; it expands it. AI acts as a creative partner, enhancing what’s possible and making a new form of collaboration between human and machine.|Title text on screen displaying the quote "The artist is no longer a solitary genius but a collaborator".|
|AI is redefining creativity. It’s not about replacing human ingenuity but augmenting it. Across different fields, AI is opening doors to new ideas, techniques, and expressions. The future of creativity and making may not be solitary but collaborative.<br><br>  <br><br>The Asia Pacific Academy of Science did a study on a group of students who were instructed to use AI in their creative process.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|They found that "despite acknowledging the ethical concerns regarding copyright and the potential replacement of artists, students appreciated the value of generative AI tools for enhancing their sketchbooks and ideation process" (Hutson and Cotroneo, 2023)|Title text on the screen typing the quote "despite acknowledging the ethical concerns regarding copyright and the potential replacement of artists, students appreciated the value of generative AI tools for enhancing their sketchbooks and ideation process"|
|Lets take a closer look at a real-life example.<br><br>  <br><br>Artists like Genel Jumalon, an award winning cover artist, navigates the concerns around AI by setting clear boundaries.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|When using AI for inspiration, Jumalon ensures any reference material is ethically sourced, often drawing from public domain works, like the art of 19th-century illustrator Jean-Léon Gérôme (Science Friday, 2022).<br><br>Genel Jumalon uses the AI image generator app Midjourney to create the initial concepts for their paintings. They then chose their favourite images from the AI prompt and complete the illustration by hand.|Images of Genel Jumalon's process to get the final painting.|
|Lets take a stepback and compare Jumalons creative process to the keyword "Make"<br><br>  <br><br>Jumalon’s process perfectly embodies the traditional definition of "making." They combine AI-generated parts with their own skill, insight, and ethical judgment to produce something entirely original. AI provides the initial spark, but the final form—the essence of the artwork—is shaped by the artist’s vision.<br><br>  <br><br>So, when we talk about "making" in the context of AI and art, it’s not about machines replacing human craftsmanship. It’s about artists using new tools to enhance their ability to combine, create, and give form to their ideas.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|It’s easy to fall into the trap of over-reliance on AI, which can dull your creativity rather than enhance it. Here’s how to maintain a healthy balance:|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|
|1. Use AI as a tool, not a crutch: Let it inspire but not dictate.<br><br>2. Set clear boundaries: Ensure that AI-generated content doesn’t blur the line between your authentic expression and artificial input.<br><br>3. Stay critical and reflective: Always question whether the AI output aligns with your creative vision.|Title image displaying each step.|
|People will use AI, whether we like it or not. The challenge is to use it responsibly and creatively. When used ethically, AI becomes a powerful collaborator, enhancing our ideas and pushing creative boundaries—without replacing the heart of the artist.|Female sitting on a beige couch holding a microphone|

### **REFLECTION**
I wanted to challenge myself with a different type of assignment format. I am tired of writing reports and essays and wanted to dip my toes into video editing again. I have edited video assignments before but have never made a video essay. I chose the video essay format because I like to watch random video essays on various topics on YouTube. I mainly watch the YouTube essayists Mina Lee and Uncarley, who mainly watch video essays on pop culture and recent events. For my video, I went on a YouTube deep dive, looking at a variety of different YouTube essayists to get a feel for the different styles of video essays that are out there. Some essayists only show them talking and explaining, some only show footage of the topic, or some film it in a podcast style where they are talking to the camera but also have brief clips of the topic. My favourite is the last option on the list, and I find it to be the most engaging format.

When choosing a topic for this video, I knew I wanted to use the word "make" for the final project. I chose a topic on AI because it went great with the word "make," and since it is such a hot topic right now, I knew I'd have lots of material to work with to make a video. I settled on the topic question quickly after that; it seemed like a give-in. I had recently seen many photos going around on the BookTok community on TikTok that showed medieval fairytale-looking scenes with knights and other things to go along with book storylines. I tried to find the artist who made them but was shocked that they were all AI-generated since they looked so real. That was the first time I couldn't differentiate AI art from real art, and that was the moment I realized how much of an issue it could become. After that, I went down a wormhole to find the program that made these. I eventually found the program, typed in a short prompt, and was wowed at how easily and quickly the image was produced. I have seen so much backlash online about using AI to make art that I wanted to challenge the other side and see if there was a way to use it without AI taking over. There is always another side to the problem, and I wanted to find it; thus, the video topic was born.

An issue I ran into was my audio needing to turn out better. I live right behind a construction site, so I could constantly hear the trucks beeping and making all sorts of noises in the background. So, for the production of the video, I ended up renting a microphone from the John F. Woods Centre on campus in the Lang building to make my audio crisper. My setup also consisted of using my propped-up phone to take the video of myself; I contemplated using my camera but found that importing the videos from my phone for editing was much more manageable.

Overall, it was fun to research and learn more about AI's impact on the art community. I now feel more educated about using AI ethically when making text-to-image content. If I could take the project and research further, I would investigate the different artists that AI has affected and what laws should be passed to combat the damage that AI has done to different industries. I would have also liked to go into more detail of each example I chose and include more of the examples I had to cut out of the final project. For example, I would've like to talk more about the different AI programs out there used to create text-to-image art as well as go into deeper detail of Genel Jumalon's processes.
