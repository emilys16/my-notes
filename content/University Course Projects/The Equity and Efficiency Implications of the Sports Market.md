Examining the equity and efficiency of sports teams, it is evident that scarcity and consumers play a role in the value and success of different sports teams. As chapter nine of _Cocktail Party Economics_ explains, "Efficiency tries to create as big a cake as possible, and equity tries to keep the pieces of the cake to a similar size[[1]](#_ftn1).” For a sports team to be efficient, they must allocate their resources without any deadweight loss, surplus, or shortages of products or players. When discussing athletes' pay on these sports teams, we discover an issue with equity; athletes typically get paid higher wages than most other careers. Equity is a concept of fairness in economics, and many people may argue that it is not fair the amount of money sports stars get paid as that money could go to better use. Chapter one of _Cocktail Party Economics_, It is All About Scarcity, and chapter 7 of _Cocktail Party Economics_, Demanding Clients, explains the efficiency and equity issue. Scarcity and demanding clients relate to how efficiently and equitably these teams allocate their resources and talent.

Scarcity plays a role in the value and success of sports when it comes to allocating the supply and demand of valuable athletes. Chapter one of _Cocktail Party Economics_ deals with the issue of scarcity. Scarcity, as described in chapter one, is "fundamentally a relative term rather than an absolute one. It captures the idea of limited resources relative to multiple recipients[[2]](#_ftn2)". Scarcity is a particular issue when it comes to the high demand for valuable players. As in other chapters, the more recognizable and talented the sports star, the more valuable the player. For example, the NBA hosts an exhibition game called the All-Star Game; this game showcases 24 of the NBA's star players. The demand for valuable basketball stars is high, while there is a

scarce supply of All-Star players, causing scarcity. The high value of scare players caused an issue with equity by athletes' inflated salaries. Currently, NBA contracts can exceed $27.5M, facing the question do they deserve all this money[[1]](#_ftn1). While athletes sacrifice family life and health to drive business profit, it also contributes to inequity within sports, threatens the future of sports, and has changed the meaning of playing for a team. While many athletes compete for money rather than the game, the "repercussions could cause long-term damage to professional sports[[2]](#_ftn2)." Scarcity causes a price change, which explains why the more valuable the player, the more money they get paid. Therefore, scarcity of players increases the value within the sports market.

In a news article by The New York Times, scarcity was used to build a passion for soccer. The article explained that The Premier League reduced the number of games broadcasted, not allowing fans to watch every game[[3]](#_ftn3). They used the concept of scarcity to build anticipation, "goals mean more, mean everything, because you never know how long you might have to wait for the next. It is here that the passion soccer can engender is rooted. It is from here that soccer draws its power[[4]](#_ftn4)." In the case of The Premier League, the quantity supplied of broadcasted games decreased, causing a scarcity of broadcasts to watch; thus, in reaction, the demand of viewers increased. In the Cocktail Party Economic Conversations Podcast, they spoke about allocating their resources to get optimal time and information to be most efficient[[5]](#_ftn5). During

the covid pandemic, many resources were scarce; thus, the podcasters spoke about consumers' panic as service professionals cancelled their services. This relates to how sports fans panicked after hearing that there would be fewer games. Due to soccer teams playing fewer games than other sports teams, scarcity significantly impacts their value.

Consumer behaviour impacts the sports market due to current social trends and demand. Chapter seven of Cocktail Party Economics, Demanding Clients, explains the concept of consumer behaviour. One of the main categories of consumer behaviour is consumer preferences, "tastes can and do change sometimes voluntarily, sometimes with a little help from societal pressure[[1]](#_ftn1)." Consumer behaviour consists of consumer preferences, attitudes, and emotions toward products or services. Consumer preferences significantly impact sports; fans are influenced by which team they cheer for based on their family and friends. People tend to follow trends and like to fit in, whether without their friend groups or online with social media. A scholarly article overviews how social media drives fan engagement in sports: "Given existing fan bases and their level of sports fandom, sports organizations are ideally positioned to benefit from social media as an engagement platform[[2]](#_ftn2)." Depending on how loyal a fan base is, interacting with posts online can change the motivations and perceptions of consumers/ fans. Therefore, consumer behaviour has an impact on the success on the sports market due to a variety of internal and external influences.

Another main category in chapter seven is the number of buyers in the market. The text explains, "if the number of buyers in a particular market goes up, the demand goes up as well.

This might seem obvious, but it is an important factor to consider when talking about demand[[1]](#_ftn1)." For instance, as athletes are being drafted and bought by different agencies, it is expected that the demand for the first-picked player to increase. The bleacher report stated, "skyrocketing salaries of number one overall picks are astounding[[2]](#_ftn2),” this goes back to the value of players and scarcity shown previously. The more teams (buyers) want the player (product), the market and demand will go up. An example to explain this concept further was in the Cocktail Party Economic Conversations Podcast when they compared the demand of sales of cookies during the covid pandemic[[3]](#_ftn3). During the pandemic, as the lockdown started, grocery stores started selling out of normal goods like cookies. The market went up due to pandemic hoarding; therefore, demand increased. The podcast displayed a great example of consumer behaviour with buyers in the market. In conclusion, the buyers in a market influences the success and value of the sports market due to the demand buyers have for the players.

Brand equity impacts the sports market by examining the value of athletes’ talents.  Brand equity is the value put on a company/ team. As stated in a report by the University of Mannheim on sports equity and efficiency, "acquiring and valuing talents and paying players according to their worth is a pivotal driver of sport-related success. As brand equity reflects exactly these managerial and marketing skills and hence investment efficiency, we propose that brand equity is not only the outcome but also an important driver of sport-related success[[4]](#_ftn4).” Brand equity directly affects the fan commitment for sports teams and sports marketing; therefore, creating brand and customer loyalty. Brand marketing increases the value of the sports

team. Teams can increase the value by investing in athletic sponsorships. For example, McDonalds has a sponsorship with the Raptors for free fries when the Raptors score a certain amount of three pointers. With sports teams utilizing the marketing and managing skills efficiently they can achieve brand equity.

In conclusion, by investigating the scarcity and consumer behaviours of sports success shows that equity and efficiency play a key role within this market. As mentioned above, scarcity has provided value and success in the market through a high demand for talented athletes. Further, the consumer behaviours provided success through consumer preferences and buyers by examining the different influences on consumers. Finally, the brand equity has provided value and success for the sports market by building brand and team loyalty. The issue of equity and efficiency was discussed above in terms of high pay for athletes compared to other industries. As well, how each concept discussed effects the pay of players.

**REFLECTION**
Throughout the writing process for the Cocktail Party Economics essay the PEAR editing was a great tool to use to improve the writing and ideas of my essay. PEAR was easy to use and very quick at handling back the document edits. I found that a combination of PEAR and Grammarly was great to figure out where my weaknesses were and how to improve on them. I enjoyed that my editor thoroughly explained what needed work with specific examples on how to fix them; I wish I could have used this service for other assignments and will continue to use it for future assignments. Although the editing process was easy and straightforward, the writing process was much more difficult in my opinion. The instructions were broad and slightly vague as of which topics to write on which I found difficult considering I am used to more structured assignments. This essay helped me to learn more about equity and efficiency and how it related to the sports market.
