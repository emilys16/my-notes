# Information Systems in a Global Business Today 
Bell Canada has established itself as a dominant player in the Canadian telecommunications industry. The company operates in an oligopolistic market, where its primary competitors are Rogers Communications, Telus, and Quebecor. Bell specializes in Wireless Internet, TV, and Smart Home solutions, catering to a diverse clientele of homeowners across the country. As a significant player in the industry, Bell Canada benefits from its extensive experience and robust infrastructure. For instance, the company is the parent company of CTV, Canada's oldest and largest private broadcast television network. Bell also owns Virgin Mobile and Lucky Mobile, enabling the company to dominate the Canadian telecommunications industry. (BCE, 2023) 

Bell Canada collaborates with its main suppliers to develop its physical assets and deliver products in a timely fashion. Historically, Huawei was the sole supplier for Bell until they were replaced by Ericsson, which now supplies the radio access network equipment and Nokia, which provides wireless 5G network to customers all over Canada. Additionally, Bell uses two satellites (Nimq 6, Nimq 4), which provide high-definition and standard-definition content depending on the connected satellite (SatBeam, 2020). Finally, Bell Canada’s main goal is to provide outstanding and reliable service to its customers across Canada. Today, Bell has over 12.4 million customers across the country. The nationwide network stretches over 99% of the population and the 5G service reaches 70% of the population, primarily in metropolitan areas (Sherif, 2023).

# Global E-Business and Collaboration 
Bell Canada operates within a hierarchical structure characterized by clear reporting lines (Winseck, 2022). At the helm of this structure are executive management and the C-suite executives, including the CEO, CIO, CFO, CHRO, and CLO, who collaborate closely with the board of directors. The current President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bell Canada, Mirko Bibic, who was appointed in January 2020, has been working within Bell since 2004 (The Org., 2024). Additionally, Bell's operations are overseen by group presidents responsible for various sectors such as small & medium business, customer experience, and the Bell Media division. Supporting executive management are senior vice presidents who lead key management groups including finance, technology and information, legal and regulatory affairs, marketing and communications, and human resources.   

Bell maintains active profiles on various social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and X. In their 2023 annual report, the company expressed its commitment to "leveraging their online and social media platforms to do a better job of keeping customers informed during outages through their social media channels” (Bell Canada, 2024). Additionally, the company's Bell Let’s Talk campaign aims to reduce the stigma around mental illness and improve access to mental health care with support from various organizations. Since its inception, the campaign has raised $139 million towards mental health initiatives (Bell Canada, 2024).

# Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy
Porter’s Competitive Forces model, the value chain and the value web model help companies develop competitive strategies using information systems. Among these frameworks, Porter’s Competitive Forces model is arguably the most widely used for understanding competitive advantage. It offers a comprehensive view of the firm, its competitors, and the broader business environment by identifying five key competitive forces: industry rivalry, the threat of new entrants, the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, and the threat of substitutes (see Appendix A, Figure 1).  

In the telecommunications industry, Bell faces intense competition due to the presence of numerous large companies operating at both national and global levels. Bell's major competitors include Rogers Communications, Telus, and Quebecor. Given that industry rivalry is high, these firms strive to offer superior products and services to differentiate themselves from competitors. To remain competitive, Bell must prioritize continuous innovation, service enhancement, and differentiation strategies. 

The threat of new entrants in the telecommunications industry is low, due to the significant capital investments, high fixed costs, regulatory approvals, and established infrastructure required to operate in this industry. Existing companies such as Bell have established strong brand recognition and customer loyalty over the years. New entrants would need to heavily invest in marketing and promotional campaigns to compete with these brands. Additionally, existing companies have a technological advantage and can produce at lower costs due to the scale of their operation, thus making it more challenging for companies to enter this highly competitive market.   

The bargaining power of suppliers is typically low to moderate. As a dominant player, Bell has significant purchasing power, allowing it to negotiate favourable terms with suppliers. However, supplier concentration, high switching costs and supplier differentiation can significantly impact the bargaining power of suppliers, allowing suppliers to negotiate terms and conditions in their favour.   

The bargaining power of buyers can be influenced by various factors such as contractual obligations, installation fees, and the need for new equipment, all of which can make it difficult to switch between service providers. However, in industries where similar products are offered, consumers can easily compare offerings and exert their bargaining power. Furthermore, the bargaining power of buyers is reinforced by their demands for competitive pricing and high-quality, reliable services, making this threat moderate to high.  

The telecommunications industry faces a high threat of substitutes due to the high variety of products and services available on the market. As technology continues to evolve, consumers have access to an ever-increasing variety of alternative communication and entertainment options. Thus, Bell must consider competitive pricing, quality and performance standards, convenience and accessibility, regulatory environment and technological advancements to stay competitive.  

Additionally, the value chain model serves as an essential tool for companies to understand their business operations and enhance their business processes. Bell uses this model to identify and analyze its primary and secondary activities. Specifically, Bell's primary activities include Inbound Logistics, Operations, Outbound Logistics, Sales and Marketing, and Services while secondary activities include Technology, Human Resource Management and Customer Relationship Management (See Appendix A, Figure 2). 

Inbound logistics refers to the procurement of network equipment, devices, and supplier relationship management. Bell's operations department focuses on network infrastructure development and maintenance, data center management, and IT systems for service delivery, customer service and technical support. Outbound logistics is responsible for delivering the product to the customer through various intermediaries, using material handling, delivery, transportation, scheduling, warehousing, and other activities. Bell’s sales and marketing department is responsible for advertising campaigns and promotions and managing sales channels through online platforms, retail stores and third-party distribution partnerships.   

Bell's secondary activities include Technology, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Human Resources (HR). The Technology department conducts research and development of new telecommunications technologies. CRM activities include customer support services, feedback management, loyalty programs, and customer retention strategies. The HR department is responsible for employee recruitment, training, retention and engagement.

# Social and Ethical Issues in MIS
When evaluating the ethical issues surrounding Bell, a notable concern arises regarding their unethical door-to-door sales practices. Numerous sales representatives were observed engaging in misleading practices, misrepresenting Bell's pricing to potential customers (Johnson et al, 2018). An instance was reported where a customer, after signing up at the door and being assured of a consistent price for two months, experienced a price increase just six months later (Johnson et al, 2018). Many customers came forward alleging deception and reported spending considerable time contacting Bell to address the issue. In response, Bell took prompt action by instituting immediate employee training (Johnson et al, 2018).   

Additionally, Bell has recently been involved in a controversy over its plan to terminate several TV newscasts following the sale of 45 of its regional radio stations (Hudes & Osman, 2024). Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized this decision, stating that the company should be aware of the consequences. He further added that this decision would have an adverse impact on the quality of local journalism and Canada's democracy (Hudes & Osman, 2024). The issue has even assumed political significance as journalism plays a crucial role in informing the public about politics and events. A decline in the quality of journalism can have far-reaching implications for how people receive political news. 

Furthermore, Bell has faced criticism over its handling of customer privacy. The company's “Relevant Advertising Program" was discontinued after it came under fire in a lawsuit that revealed it tracked users' online, phone, and TV activity, as well as personal details like demographics and location (Boutilier, 2019). This breach of privacy left many customers feeling uneasy. In an effort to address these concerns, Bell has since replaced the program with the "Tailored Marketing Program," which requires customers' consent before collecting their information (Boutilier, 2019).  This approach reflects the principle of risk aversion, as obtaining consent helps to minimize harm and reduce the likelihood of future legal challenges.

# Foundations of Business Intelligence: Database and Information Management 
Bell provides services tailored for managing large databases, such as their Cloud and Data Centre and Security services, catering to the needs of large organizations. Regarding the utilization of technologies for data management within its business processes, while specific details about Bell's internal technology infrastructure remain undisclosed to the public, it's common for companies of similar stature to employ a diverse range of technologies. These may include Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems, which integrate various business functions into a unified platform, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems for managing customer interactions and data, Cloud Computing platforms for scalable data storage and processing, Big Data Technologies for handling large volumes of data, and Data Governance and Security Solutions for ensuring compliance with regulations and safeguarding against breaches. 

In terms of information policy and data governance, Bell, being a prominent telecommunications entity, has established comprehensive practices. These encompass aspects such as Data Privacy Compliance, Data Classification to determine protection levels, Data Access Controls to limit unauthorized access, Data Retention and Disposal policies for proper management, Data Security Measures including encryption and firewalls, and Training and Awareness programs to educate employees on their roles in maintaining data integrity and security.

# Cloud Services and Network 
Bell Canada offers a comprehensive range of cloud services, encompassing both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions. Tailored specifically for small and medium businesses, Bell's App Store delivers essential business applications via the cloud, while Office 365 from Bell bundles Microsoft's popular software and apps into a single, cloud-based service (Bell Canada, 2013). Moreover, Bell Canada's cloud solutions include professionally managed services, offering fully managed private cloud connectivity to enhance security, speed, performance, and reliability for critical workloads and applications (Bell Canada, 2024). Additionally, Bell Cloud Backup and Disaster Recovery ensure cost-effective backup solutions integrated with existing infrastructure, ensuring rapid replication, failover, and recovery to sustain business continuity in the event of a disaster (Bell Canada, 2024). Additionally, through leveraging strategic partnerships, Bell Canada hosts various services and technologies on its cloud platform, including Amazon's AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and WM Ware (Bell Canada, 2024). Through these offerings, Bell Canada aims to meet diverse business needs while ensuring robustness, scalability, and efficiency in cloud operations.  

Bell relies extensively on its robust network infrastructure to drive its business operations. Operating a comprehensive array of telecommunications infrastructure, encompassing wired and wireless networks, fiber optic cables, and satellite systems, Bell ensures seamless connectivity and communication for its customers. The significance of these networks amplifies with the increasing subscriber base, fostering greater connectivity and facilitating enhanced communication among users. With substantial investments amounting to nearly $8 billion in network development, as outlined in their 2023 annual report, Bell reaffirms its commitment to providing reliable and accessible services to Canadians (Bell Canada, 2024). Leveraging expertise and strict operational governance processes, Bell has established the largest and fastest-growing fiber network in Canada, extending its reach to more regions in Atlantic Canada, Québec, Ontario, and Manitoba. Looking ahead, Bell aims to boost network capacity, enhance resilience, and extend services to rural and remote communities nationwide, demonstrating its dedication to advancing connectivity across the country (Bell Canada, 2024).

# Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise 
Given the nature of telecommunications and digital services, Bell Canada likely employs a hybrid model. For physical goods like smartphones, routers and other telecommunications equipment, a more push-based approach could be employed, utilizing forecasts to ensure that inventory levels are maintained across its retail and distribution network to meet anticipated customer demand. For digital services, a pull-based approach would be prevalent, with network resources and digital content being allocated and optimized based on real-time usage and demand patterns from customers.  

Bell’s approach aligns with broader trends observed in in customer experience management and digital transformation efforts across various industries. Their strategy reflects a keen understanding of the shifts and customer expectations, emphasizing the need for digital-first, contactless, and insights driven experiences. In summary Bell Canada’s approach reflects a comprehensive understanding of the shifts in customer expectations and the strategic importance of digital transformation. By prioritizing customer-centric, insights-driven and collaborative strategies, Bell is well-positioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the evolving telecommunications landscape.

# E-Commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
Bell has their own e-commerce store, where it offers a range of products and services, including phone and internet plans, business mobility plans, Fibe TV, cloud hosting, home bundles, and hardware for services. The company's e-commerce platform has been immensely successful, generating $24.67 billion in revenue in 2023. Bell has various sources of revenue coming from many programs they offer. Residential Internet revenue growth was 7.1% in 2023 (“BCE Reports”, 2024). The mobile phone customer base has grown by 3.4% from 2022 to 2033 (“BCE Reports”, 2024). Bell's e-commerce revenue model differs from the traditional-product revenue model, primarily because of its pay plans.  The company offers customers the option to pay off their purchases over a specific period, such as a 2-year phone plan with an internet package. 

When evaluating the difference between Bell’s e-/m-commerce-revenue model and the traditional-product revenue model, technological advancement in e-commerce has provided several opportunities for Bell. Bell can offer plans online that can be paid off over a specific period. For example, they offer 2-year plans for phones as well as plan add-ons (Bell Canada, 2024). They also have a business marketplace for cloud servers, where customers can purchase and manage multiple could services (Bell Canada, 2024). Bell’s use of E-commerce allows them to sell their products and services online, rather than requiring customers to go in stores to purchase products and services. This is a major development that makes purchasing much more convenient and accessible, which would have a positive impact on Bell’s revenue.
