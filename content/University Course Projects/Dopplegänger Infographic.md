## Reflection
When creating this infographic, I frequently referenced the ones shown in class. Additionally, I looked through the Canva templates to decide the style that best fits my information. I like the blocky infographic style because it is easier to follow and read. My infographic was visually and verbally successful because it combines cohesive images and colours to organize the information; having the text in a large font and evenly spread out with subheadings makes it more accessible to read. The most challenging part of creating an infographic was simplifying a complex topic into a concise few words. These graphics are great for a quick overview and understanding but cannot correctly convey layered information. I have always found the topic of "Doppelgänger" intriguing since it is embedded into the media and literature I engage with. While researching the keyword, I observed a relation between the keyword "Identity," as discussed in class. The keywords used together allow for a deep dive into analyzing your self-perception and how it pertains to your view of the different aspects of your personality.
