Aritzia is planning on doubling its product line by 2025 by adding more depth to its current line with the size, length and colours and developing new styles and categories including swimwear, intimates, and men’s wear.

## Business Summary
Aritzia is a Canadian company that is a fashion boutique that creates, develops, and designs brands. It currently has products including t-shirts, bodysuits, sweaters, shirts, pants, leggings, shorts, dresses, skirts, blazers, outerwear, shoes, bags, scarves, sunglasses, and hats. The Company owns brands including TNA, Wilfred, Super World, Sunday Best, Denim Forum, Auxiliary, main Character, Talula, Babaton, Levi’s Premium, New Balance, Clarks, and Wildflower (ATZ). In 2022, Aritzia had key achievements in environmental, social, and governance. Aritzia is very focused on sustainability and the environment. They have adopted more sustainable fabrics including organic and recycled cotton, and other recycled fabrics such as polyester and nylon. Aritzia also achieved carbon neutrality for the second year in a row. As a community brand, Aritzia supports those around them, which they proved by providing $31 million during the Covid-19 pandemic to their relief fund. This year Aritzia also signed on as a participant to the United Nations Global Compact. (Annual report, 2022). 

## Competitive Advantage 
Aritzia strongest competitive advantage is its brand recognition. While fashion choices continue to change, Aritzia sells clothes that can be worn across fashion trends and time periods. Aritzia sells high-quality products that provide affordable luxury.  

Aritzia has a strong eCommerce platform that grew 81.3% from 2020 to 2021 and grew another 32.5% from 2021 to 2022 (Annual report, 2022). This allows customers to shop from any location without physically entering an Aritzia boutique. Even though revenue decreased in 2021 due to the global pandemic, eCommerce helped provide sales for the company and made their products easily accessible (See appendix 1).This is key to Aritzia’s success as they can stay one step ahead of their competitors as they continue to grow in both size and revenue which is evident from the year 2022 increase in sales in both eCommerce and well as retail.  

Aritzia also supports the community it is surrounded by in many ways. The bags Aritzia uses at their boutique showcases artwork from artist Lea Colombo. She is originally from South Africa but now lives in London. Her artwork is meant to be inspirational and adds an element to Aritzia's boutique as the bags are original and makes the boutique feel like one of a kind. (Artistic License, n.d.) (See appendix 2).

# Situation Analysis
## Industry Analysis 
Aritzia conducts its business in the apparel market. The apparel market is competitive with Aritzia controlling a whopping 0.0013% of the clothing market (Yahoo 2022). The clothing industry has high demand as consumers are always changing their preferences and therefore, the clothing companies are always changing their designs. The direct buyers for Aritzia consist of girls aged 14-25, with most of Ariztia's customers coming from this category. These consumers have similar clothing and style preferences, this makes it easy for Aritzia to have a substantial portion of this demographic shopping in their stores. The apparel market has 1000s of distributers of clothing and manufacturers, this allows for customization and needs to be met. The clothing industry is one of the most heavily influenced by trends on social media, this means that if you have a poor brand image you are going to struggle to keep up with companies that have good brand images. Overall, the apparel industry is extremely competitive, the risk of black-market versions of products we sell being sold is high. Aritzia's products are a part of the quality goods market, this means knockoffs are not much of a concern.

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
Aritzia has many strengths as a company. The company saw massive growth in our ecommerce sales, growing 36% over the past 4 years. The company has a great public image, and along with this they have a good relationship with their employees. With a great company image the company has also been able to get considerable amounts of brand recognition. Through the COVID-19 pandemic the company gave their employees 25 million in the form of covid relief and bonuses. The company's stock has seen a rise of 294% in the past 5 years (Pro, 2022). This is due to Aritzia's rapid expansion, the company has opened 33 new stores in the past 5 years. This is contributing to our brand recognition and customer base. What Aritzia is known for is selling top quality products and we have built a large customer base from this.
### Weaknesses
The company has a lot of weaknesses, with staff, our ability to pay off our debts, among others. Some of the staff have described Aritzia's work environment as toxic and say the company does not support the staff. This is an area that needs improvement because when there are labor disputes in companies, the company ends up being the “bad guy” in the eyes of the public. This is bad, it would drive down sales and leave the company up to skepticism from the public. Another weakness the company has is our ability to pay off our debts, we do not have enough cash on hand to pay off our debt. This is a weakness right now but soon will not be an issue because of our rapid expansion and as our new stores begin to pay themselves off, we will see our ability to pay our debts go up.
### Opportunities
The fashion industry is rich with opportunities. The best opportunities for Aritzia come from modern technology and social media. Social media is a new way for brands and companies to grow a customer base online. There are also opportunities in the manufacturing sector such as 3D printing clothes and other accessories. Items can be 3D printed from a range of materials such as steel and various plastics. Another opportunity for Aritzia would be an app that their loyal customers can download. This app would enable Aritzia to reward its loyal customers through coupons and in-app promotions. This is a large opportunity for Aritzia to grow its revenue as well as a loyal customer base.
### Threats 
We are in a market that has lots of competitors, many of the threats Aritzia faces come from this. Such as knock-off items being produced. This comes from brands that have cheaper labor costs and sell inferior products, this allows them to undercut Ariztia's prices by a large margin. We have an extensive list of direct competitors Shein, H&M, Old navy, and Dynamite to name a few (Ning, 2022). Another threat is the changing demographics of the fashion industry. This is due to a drop in consumer confidence in the economy, customers are going to cheaper brands that offer comparable products. This is a problem when it comes to the fashion industry, every company is fighting for a small piece of the same pie.

## Competition 
The retail industry is highly competitive with a monopolistic competition industry structure. Retail stores compete for customer loyalty and profit. Aritzia’s competitors include Zara, Urban Outfitters, and American Eagle. Retail stores actively adapt and changed to stay on top of new trends while simultaneously competing with product differentiation. Companies can provide a variety of discounts, promotions, and deals to attract consumers and compete with other competitors. With the rise in technology trends are changing at a rapidly increasing rate; thus, the retail industry must compensate causing more competition among competitors.  

Zara is one of Aritzia’s top competitors, operating in 88 countries, being one of the biggest fashion brands in the industry (Business of Fashion, 2019). Selling similar trendy luxury clothing for a younger customer base; Zara reaches consumers globally by focusing heavily on the locations of the retail stores rather than advertising through commercials and ads The secret of Zara’s success, 2021). Urban outfitter operates over 685 stores globally using loyalty program and rewards program to keep their community engaged (Statistica, 2019). They sell similar clothing and uses brand partners and famous people to boost their brand like Aritzia. American Eagle is a somewhat close competitor to Aritzia by occupying the same demographics and audience. American Eagle has over 880 stores globally and uses digital adverting through social medias to reach their target audience (Monllos, 2022).

## Company Analysis 
Aritzia’s mission is to “deliver everyday luxury through engaging service, beautiful product, aspirational environments, and captivating communications” (Aritzia, 2022). Further, Aritzia strives to reduce the impact they have on the environment by sourcing and producing their clothing sustainably. Aritzia is also carbon neutral when manufacturing their products and uses sustainable recyclable packaging for all their products (Aritzia, 2022).  

Aritzia started as a standalone boutique at the Vancouver Oakridge Centre in 1984, where it was started by the Hill family. There are now over 100 Aritzia boutiques across North America as well as an ecommerce store reaching a global audience. Their mission and value remain consistent from the beginning as they continue to remain sustainable while simultaneously offering beautiful clothing and aspirational spaces (Aritzia, 2022). Aritzia sells a wide variety of clothing options for everyone but focuses on their main demographic of young women ages 15 to 35; they reach their target audiences through a variety of in-house brands including but not limited to Wilfred, Babaton, and Sunday Best.  

Aritzia has a comparative advantage in the apparel industry as they have tapped into a niche market of sustainable and affordable luxury clothing. Aritzia is the strongest sustainable brand currently on the market by selling timeless and multifunctional quality clothing. There is also a competitive advantage over advertising as Aritzia becomes increasingly popular among celebrities; thus, allowing the brand to advertising through social media partners and digital promotions (Eldor, 2022). This results in an increase in demand for clothing promoted by celebrities or influencers; thus, increasing net revenue.

## Customer Analysis
When looking at the consumers for this new line of products, we can take a look at Aritzia’s general consumers. “The company enjoys high satisfaction amongst the coveted 20–40-year-old women’s demographic. It is positioned above larger fashion retailers like H&M and The Gap” (Murray Wealth Group, 2019). We can see that Aritzia puts most of their time and resources into keeping up with trends that fit the younger to middle-aged population, as this is who shops at their stores the most. With jewelry currently being in style, this product would be a good product when looking at consumer wants and would be targeted at this 20–40-year-old consumer age group. Through reviews, it is also shown that many of the shops at Aritzia are satisfied and like their purchases, with the average rating being a 4.4 / 5 (Influenster, n.d.).  Because of these high ratings, the products must be constructed well and remain at a reasonable price for consumers. We can achieve this by using gold and silver that will meet and exceed consumer standards, but price the products at prices lower than the competition. People that are looking to shop at Aritzia will see the new advertised jewelry, and as being loyal customers, they will go and check it out.

# Marketing Strategy
## Market Segmentation 
The apparel industry acts as intermediaries between the manufacturers and the consumers of the clothing; therefore, Aritzia’s industrial segment is the manufacturers that produce the clothing and the customers that purchase clothing for retail store (Berlinsbi, 2019). This is due to Aritzia products not having a “middleman” purchasing their product to use for other brands. Aritzia has a variety of different consumers that purchase clothing from the brand. Further consumer segments of Aritzia’s demographics include environmentally conscious customers, these customers are attracted to the way Aritzia sustainably produce and manufacture their clothing. University students looking for trendy business attire is another segment; these customers enjoy not paying a large price for quality formal wear. Also, middle class and upper-middle class young women is a demographic segment of the Aritzia brand. This is due to Aritzia attracting customers looking for luxury clothing.

## Target Market
For the introduction of the new jewelry line Aritzia’s target market includes consumers looking for trendy designs and sustainable production. Due to the product including logos and is a clear symbol of Aritzia athletic leisure line of products, the first jewelry launch would not be suitable for those who are looking for formal or business attire. Therefore, Aritzia should focus product promotions for the jewelry launch to a younger trendy demographic. The new jewelry line is for casual wear allowing for anyone to wear the pieces. As well, the new line is produced ethically and sustainably like the rest of Aritzia’s product lines. Consumers who are looking for sustainably produces jewelry would benefit from the product.

## Positioning 
As stated on their website and annual reports, one of Aritzia’s main goals is to provide “high-quality, beautifully designed product” (Aritzia, 2022). Aritzia positions itself as a company that develops a variety of products that will meet customers' expectations of luxury and made to last clothing. Aritzia’s new jewelry line positions itself to be a luxury everyday collection of jewelry at an affordable price. Due to the Aritzia brand being catered towards upper-class, the jewelry being worn can be positioned as a luxury status symbol.

# Marketing Mix "4 P's"
## Products/ Services 
Aritzia products have been and continue to be very popular. Like discussed earlier the target market is focused on women and mostly in middle class and upper-middle class consumers. Aritzia sells their luxury products in over 100 stores across North American and all around the world through their ecommerce platform. The products that Aritzia sells at the moment include clothing items like; shirts, shorts, jeans, hoodies, dresses, and jackets. They have been growing their markets by selling different types of products like shoes, socks, and masks. Aritzia also sells other outside companies at their stores; items like New Balance shoes, Levi’s denim, and Calvin Klein undergarments. The new product that Aritzia is planning to manufacture is a line of jewelry, more specifically necklaces, earrings, and rings. These jewelry items will all contain the TNA logo, which is Aritzia's brands of athletic and leisure clothing. Our line will include both gold and silver metal options to choose from as well as a variety of sizes.

| Necklace             | Earrings             | Ring |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
| ![[tnanecklace.png]] | ![[tnaearrings.png]] |      ![[tnaring.png]]|
## Price
Aritzia is a luxury brand which means that their prices are a bit higher than most of their competition. Although Aritzia has many competitors for consumers to choose from, many are loyal to Ariztia due to their high quality and sustainable clothing. Aritzia's biggest clothing competitors are Zara, Lululemon, American Eagle, and Urban Outfitters. Aritzia sells clothing with price ranges from $88 to $128 (Women's Clothing & Accessories on Sale, 2022). Lululemon prices range from $48 to $150 (Everything you need to know about lululemon, 2022).  

 Tiffany and Pandora would be Aritzia’s competition for the new jewelry product line. Looking at Tiffany and Pandora prices, the majority of their products range from $45 to$80. Further, both companies have more expensive products as well. Due to Aritzia having a smaller product line compared to the competition, consumers will have less choices to choose from. Our prices would range between $30 to 80$ depending on which product and metal the consumer chooses. For example, if the consumers would like to purchase gold jewelry, it would be more expensive than if they choose silver instead. Therefore, our basic pricing schedule is focused on the different quality of materials. Looking at our bulk price, we would start by selling our new jewelry only to our loyal customers, so they understand that it is important to us that they are loyal to us, and this is giving them an opportunity to be before other people. Our customer feedback is important to our company, it will be analyzed to make sure that customer opinions and requirements are involved in our products. Customer comments will help us to make sure our products are as high quality as possible. Once we adjust the product again, we will have other trials offering promotional pricing to new customers.(see appendix 3).

## Place
People ahead of the market is one of the strategies we will be using for distribution. Our selection will be made by successful and loyal consumers. This distribution strategy would let the select participants buy our jewelry in advance, knowing not everyone could get it. Other consumers that were not invited to that ahead of the market will want to buy our jewelry as soon as they can due to the exclusivity surrounding the products. This strategy will create a good word of mouth from loyal customers to other consumers; thus, increasing the traffic of new customers. This is called the Challenge Groups.  

The second method of distribution is direct sales. During the first six months, Aritzia will be using direct sales to reach our consumers and to promote our new products coming up. Industry events are another good way to make your products well known. Making an appearance at important events like recruitment events will make Aritzia more well-known and will show that they are just as good as the competition. Other types of appearances Aritzia could make are posting on social media platforms and websites. By doing so, Ariztia is promoting the products to millions of people leading to images being reposted; thus, spreading the brand allows other people to see that they may not have come across Aritza through any other forms of promotion as well. Another way for Aritzia to promote is to continue to have famous people, including celebrities and influencers, to use and promote our products. For the campaign sponsorship, famous people can take a photoshoot of them wearing their jewelry line and have them repost the photo on their social media. This promotional tactic will allow more people to see our product due to the large following these celebrities have. Another way Aritzia can promote the products is through product placement in projects such as videos clips, movies, commercials, and television shows.  

 Aritzia's store layout is similar in every store. This includes dressing rooms at the back of the store, racks lining the walls and tables of clothing in the middle of the store. As well there are seating areas and registers in the middle of the store. Putting the jewelry close to the cash would be the ideal place so that people could see them right before purchasing other products.
## Promotion
There are many ways Aritzia could promote the products. First is public profiling, it is strategies using articles, writing pieces, websites. This is a good way to get the different generations to be able to know more about their products. Another big way to promote is bloggers. People wearing the products while filming themselves then posting them would allow viewers to see how good it looks on other people. Lastly there are the strategy alliances, partnering with other companies to try to get their customers to buy our product.  Advertising is an important one as well, bringing the products out to our customers causing the public to have a certain respond which would tell the company what to improve. Some examples of advertising are Flyers and Billboards. Some sales promotion would be a good way to attract people to buy your products like the buy one, get one free or first purchase coupon...  Public relations are always important since you sell your products to customers. Some ways to have more public relations are partnering with influences, local tv, using social media. The last important advertising is direct marketing like texts, social media, email... Those are all different ways that Aritzia could promote their products to the public.

# Financial Projections
When looking at the financial projections for our new jewelry line, we can take a look at Aritzia’s general sales.
![[arritziafinancial.png]]
By looking at some of Aritzia’s general sales, we can see that the gross profit is high, so there is success in the company. This is good because it shows that when new products are released if consumers value the product in the same way as they have with other of the company's products, the jewelry should be successful. Because the jewelry is priced in the $30-80 range, it is a good price compared to the competition in the industry. When making our short-term projection, we projected that we would make roughly $415750 in our first year. This was calculated by looking at the population of our age range for females in Ontario, which was roughly 831,500 people (Statistics Canada). Assuming roughly 0.75 percent of those people purchase the product, that would bring us $415750 in revenue. It is also important to note that the jewelry line may bring forth new customers which may purchase other items along with the jewelry at the same time which will also increase Aritzia’s revenue.  

When making the long-term projection, we looked at the jewelry industry’s growth rate. From 2022 to 2030, the industry is estimated to grow by 7.6% (GVE, 2022). When using this data, we can make estimate that our revenue will reach 3.12 million or more. This means that if things like taxes, price of materials, and inflation rates remain the same we will make 3.12 million over the next 8 years. This is important to note because if the first launch is successful there is room for expansion in this industry which could lead to even larger success for Aritzia.  

Finally, to market our product we will use advertising including billboards and flyers. Billboards cost roughly $7000 monthly in bigger cities (Indeed, n.d), which is where our target market would be. Assuming we would like to have multiple billboards, we can estimate that we will have 35 of them. This means that we will spend roughly 245000 per month on billboards alone. These prices will also change based on the location and size of the billboard. This advertisement technique would only be used for the first month of the product release as it is very costly and greatly depreciates the profit Aritzia is making from the jewelry line. 

We could also implement social media advertisements which cost roughly 0.40-0.60 dollars per ad on Instagram. The younger female generation is Aritzia’s target market which many are on social media daily and can be repeatedly exposed to the new product.

## Implementation Plan 
The product rollout of our new Aritzia themed jewelry is planned to happen in two stages. Our first stage is product promotion, and our second stage is product release. To promote our product, we will have popular social media stars do product reviews to bring interest in the new line of products. This is a great way for our company to create hype around the new Jewlery line, this is when Aritzia will pre-release the items to select customers. Aritzia will release the product line completely shortly after this, this kind of release makes the consumer feel like they are getting something special.  

The company needs an action plan and a set of goals to complete. The company's first goal is to organize a timeline for the company to follow for the product release. This will keep production efficient and have everyone on the same page. The second goal our company should be to have the company create brand ambassadors through its app to keep the brand growing and have a real-world connection to the brand. The third goal should be to always keep the customers happy and safe. This will allow the company to have a pleasant experience with the customers and give them something that will be remembered by them.

## Timeline
The company will start with production of the Jewlery 3 months before the release is announced. Then the company can slowly begin product roll out through the social media influencers and their fan bases (Social media 2018). Then once the company has people talking about it, they release the Jewlery product line to the public in all stores. This plan works well because when the product line is released the company already has built up extra stored products and does not sell out, for customer convenience. The customer will be satisfied with the product they receive, this will create a drive for our products and brands. The product will be released at the same time to the eCommerce allowing customers to either purchase online or visit in store to see the new product line.

## Key Activities 
Some of the key activities for the company include our social media Collab with creators, this added large groups of people to our consumer list. The main key activity for our company is to open more stores in the United States. The company has opened 11 stores this year so far with plans for another 8-10 more (Vancouver sun 2022). The continued growth will be a result of our brand recognition and our ability to satisfy new customers' needs. With this rapid growth there will be higher demand for Aritzia's products. The company should invest in making more efficient factories and manufacturing plants. These upgrades will allow the company to keep up with high demand in all sectors and keep the company going. Overall implementation of our product. Our jewelry line will be available in stores and online for customers. The jewelry will not be available for everyone at the start of the release (larger stores will receive the product first). Within a month, the full product line will be available to purchase at all locations.

## Evaluation and Control 
The success of the jewelry line will be evaluated from both a financial perspective and from a customer perspective. From the financials, the success of the plan will be evaluated based on the increase of sales the new jewelry line provides. The jewelry must add value to Aritzia for the line to continue and expand. The product will only be purchased once by each consumer but due to the cohesiveness between the necklace, earrings, and bracelet the hopes are for valuable customers to be satisfied with the collection and purchase the set.  

From the view of the consumer, their satisfaction of the jewelry collection will be monitored based on feedback, surveys, and social media reviews. Surveys will be offered both in store and online through Aritzia’s website for customers to access anytime and be provided with 10% off their next purchase if filled out. The feedback will assist Aritzia in moving forward with the jewelry line to make improvements or how to expand. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook are used by Aritzia and allow customers to comment and engage with Aritzia and provide insight and opinions based on their products. This allows the customer to feel their opinions being valued and helps Aritzia know if the jewelry line fulfilled their consumers' needs and expectations of the products. Aritzia can launch their products and promote through these channels and then receive back feedback before they proceed on another launch.  

With the new product, Aritzia is hoping to see an 5% increase in sales in the first three months of the product launch. The divide between eCommerce and in-store sales is projected to be 30% and 70% respectively as it is expected most will want to try the new products and see their in-person quality before purchasing. The product launch will be deemed unsuccessful if in the first quarter the product line is launched there is no visible increase in sales from the same quarter in the previous year.  

The number of consumers projected to purchase this product is approximately 50% of its current customer base as these are loyal customers who would feel inclined to purchase this product. It is projected that a success of the product launch will also result in long term sales increase as a customer would be inclined to purchase one of the products and if they are satisfied with it, they will purchase the remainder of the product line which will continue to expand if the products are deemed successful.  

This product launch will be ceased if sales decrease due to product launch or negative public relations arise. Aritzia values its social involvement and its success as a profitable company. Implementation of a product that harms these factors of success is unnecessary. If the sales generated from the launch of the product forecasts that it will not cover advertisement and implementation costs these product line will need revamped, reconstructed and repositioned as Aritzia has already invested large sums of money into the company and to fold and remove the product line now would result in severe losses for the company. 

After the product line is well underway it will continue being controlled to ensure it continues to add between 2-5% sales to the company to deem itself worthy in the store and online. Aritzia needs to be able to use the feedback to improve as satisfying the customer is the largest concern, especially for a new product that has not gained a reputation yet as this is the point to make important changes for the product in the future.
