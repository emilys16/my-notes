A very close family member (or your best friend) is marrying a US politician and requested your help. The project is to organize the wedding party on Dec 2. The project includes a three-day drive from Guelph to Orlando, Florida, where the party will be held. There are usually significant accidents along the route.  Her father has allocated a budget of CND $100,000 for the party and will pay the bills up to this amount. The groom will allocate a budget of USD 100,000 and will pay the bills up to this amount. The groom wants to use the occasion for fundraising and wants facilities for this purpose.

- Catering, photographer, decorator, and meeting equipment will be provided in packages by the venue
- Avoid scope creep by establishing a change control process and keeping complex project objectives on track
- The wedding party does not have any last-minute changes and all guests invited are in attendance without passport complications.
- The application to fundraise with the Starlight Children’s Foundation Canada is approved.

### Schedule Statement
The project will take 69 hours at least. Although I budgeted for 95 hours, this means I have some slack and can spend more time researching, planning, and coordinating with the wedding party as long as I do not exceed the extra 26 slack hours.

Taking into account that the bride submitted a change request form (see Appendix A) and changes the band a few weeks into the project and wants to add ice cream for guests, I have enough time budget and accounting budget in the extra slack hours to accommodate the new band and addition to catering order.

# Project Budget Summary
The total budget for this project is 95 hours, since the project will take approximately 19 weeks, working 5 hours per week.

For the project budget I used a Bottom-Up approach for estimating project times and costs. Using the Template Method, I used a similar past project as a starting point for this wedding project.

As shown below, out of the USD $174,488 budget, I plan to spend USD $144,283 total on the road trip, wedding reception/ceremony, and the fundraiser. That gives us USD $30,205 of slack.

# Stakeholder Management and Communication Plan
## Stakeholder Register
- **Bride and Groom**: The main stakeholders whose vision and preferences are the most important
- **Father of the Bride**: Providing large sum of funding and therefore has a say in financial decisions.
- **Wedding Organizer**: Responsible for managing the project, budgeting, and ensuring all needs and concerns are met.
- **Wedding Party and Guests**: key participants in the wedding festivities.
- **Fundraising Team**: This group will handle donation collection, marketing and setup for the fundraiser requested by the groom.
- **Vendors and Suppliers**: This group includes wedding venue, staff in Orlando, caterers, decorators, photographers, florists, and musicians.
- **Government and Local Authorities**: Since this is a political wedding there may be a need for additional security.
- **Media**: Since the groom is significant US politician, the event may require careful PR if it attracts media attention.
