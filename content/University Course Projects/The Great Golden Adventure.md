#### Design Influence
We tested the text game *The Oregon Trail*. It influenced our own design by using an adventure type theme.

#### Game Premise and Creation Process
The premise of our game is to go on a hunt using your late grandfathers old treasure map to find hidden gold. During the creation process we encountered challenges in defining the functions. Each newly defined function needed to be put in a certain order for the code to run properly. In the future we would like to add more branches to the story and try to make the defined functions more concise. 


```python
# Import a python library called time
import time

def game_over(message): # "You lose" function that ends the game
    print(" ")
    print(message)
    print("Game Over. You Lose.")
    time.sleep(2)  # brief pause before exiting
    quit() #end game

def boat(): # (A) of choice 1
    time.sleep(2)
    print(" ")
    print("You come aboard the boat and navigate the rising tides and crashing waves until the storm is too much to bear.")
    print("You notice a small island in the distance but worry that the tides are too strong and will push you off-course.")
    print(" ")
    time.sleep(2)
    return
    
def helicopter(): # (B) of choice 1

    print("You get on the helicopter and fly towards the treasure.")
    print("As you fly, the winds grow more and more dangerous.")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(" ")
    print("On your radar, you notice a small chunk of land.")
    print("'It may just be debris from the storm messing up the signals,' you think to yourself.")
