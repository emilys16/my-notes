# Introduction 
Canadian infrastructure is deteriorating at a rapid rate; the government needs to invest more money in the federal budget to upgrade and increase the country’s infrastructure. The recent recession has caused a loss of jobs, negatively impacting the economy. In addition, the COVID-19 Pandemic has caused damage to our international trade routes, and investment can significantly improve the lives of Canadian Citizens. *For the needs of Canada and its citizens to be met, more money must be put into our federal budget for infrastructure.*

# Research Overview 
Infrastructure is vital to a country’s economic health. It accounts for supporting networks, the production of public goods and production processes; this includes public transportation, education systems, water treatment, and communication networks. Unfortunately, Canada’s infrastructure ranking has dropped in recent years.  

Jobs in Infrastructure help to improve and revitalize communities across the country. As mentioned in chapter 7: In Labour, in the book Dinner Party Economic, “The most important input people bring to the business community is labour... national well-being and paid 

employment is connected.” In 2019, 3.6% of Canadas total hours worked was infrastructure-related jobs, thus, making it a significant category of Canadas yearly Gross Domestic Product and economic income. Jobs in the Canadian infrastructure include engineers, architects, project managers, analysts, and labour workers. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, there was widespread job loss in all sectors, including many parts of the Canadian infrastructure. Sectors, including the Canada Infrastructure Bank, the education system, and the healthcare system, were hit hard, resulting in mass job loss.

Trade is a vital aspect of Canada’s gross domestic product, “Canada has been under-investing in trade-enabling infrastructure”vi. As a result, Canada has dropped from the top 10 for most reliable trade infrastructure to number 32. The lack of global trade contributes to a loss in growth and poverty. As mentioned in chapter 10: International Cheques and Balances, in the book Dinner Party Economics, “countries that “protect” themselves from imports… reduce the well-being of the majority of their citizen..” Many countries cut trade routes off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so by reopening more trade and trade agreements Canada can rebuild its international trade sector. The book also mentioned that “free trade increases the wealth of nations because every country specializes in what it is good at and then trades those items or services for the specialized products or services of other countries. As this continues, the volume of both imports and exports of all countries increases.” This research shows that if Canada opens its economy more, it will experience better gains from trade.

“Critical infrastructure is the backbone to modern society, and it is essential to national prosperity,” which includes the quality of life of Canadian citizens. As mentioned in chapter 3: Measure for Measure, in the book Dinner Party Economics, the research conducted on human happiness found that the main factor for happiness is an economic factor. Factors such as income, unemployment, and inflation contribute to a person’s happiness. There has been a significant decline in quality of life in recent years; increased inflation, the housing crisis, job loss, and rising food prices have contributed to putting Canadians in challenging financial situations. The continuous improvement of quality of life is essential to the Federal government. Happy citizens equal happy workers equal better productivity.

# Analysis
Investing trade infrastructure in the federal budget will create new international trade developments. This can be achieved by reducing transportation costs between countries and increasing internal and external trade integration. Investing in major transportation network changes will positively affect population migration, trading goods, and commuting, thus, allowing growth in Canada’s gross domestic product. In addition, network infrastructure like transportation and communication improves business efficiency by managing supply chains, product delivery, and coordination mechanisms. Examples of how it is possible to improve Canada’s trade infrastructure include updating and enhancing digital technologies trade services and opening more trade routes between countries. The growth of international trade creates new economic opportunities for Canada to expand its markets to new countries and investors.

Investing in infrastructure improves the quality of life. Quality of life is defined as “the degree to which an individual is healthy, comfortable, and able to participate in or enjoy life events.” There are many ways the Federal government can improve quality of life by investing in infrastructure. For example, as more cities become "walkable cities,” transportation is relied on more heavily. An expedited bus or train home after a long workday would prove more efficient and destressing than sitting in bumper-to-bumper in rush hour traffic. Further, upgrading and maintaining better public transportation takes less of a financial burden on families because it is cheaper than driving. Moreover, investing in water treatment facilities will improve the quality of life. Water treatment helps remove harmful substances and contaminants from the water supply, ensuring it is safe to drink and use for cooking. Providing safe water lessens the chances of Canadian citizens from getting sick. Infrastructure is vital to maintaining a happy population. Investing in infrastructure will create more jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of integrating long-term planning into Canadian Infrastructure. New infrastructure developments can create numerous jobs in the Canadian trades, manual labour force, and manufacturing sector. For example, fixing roads, building new treatment plants, and building new trade routes, required new teams, and expanding new departments/firms. Thus, new job opportunities for workers in the mentioned fields are created. Moreover, the federal government can invest in digital connectivity will give people in the workforce increased access to jobs that closely match their related skills. Infrastructure investment will provide many ways for Canadians to obtain employment in many other sectors.

# How To Fund 
To fund the extra investment in infrastructure, the federal government must adjust and take from another section of the budget. Cutting military/defense budget spending and redistributing to the infrastructure would benefit the Canadian economy more. In 2021, the funding for military/defense was $26.45 Billion, a 13.61 increase from the previous year. In contrast, the budget for infrastructure was $33.5 billion over 11 years. Continually spending on defense equipment increases the national debt and decreases Canada's GDP as national defense is not profitable. Military and defence also do not directly benefit Canadian citizens' individual lives. If that money were used for public infrastructure, Canada’s GDP would expand outward due to increased jobs and trade. Therefore, redirecting a portion of the military/ defense budget to infrastructure will more greatly benefit the needs of Canadian citizens and the economy.

# Conclusion 
Suppose the Federal budget invests more in the Canadian Infrastructure, it is evident that it will have positive economic impacts by improving quality of life for all Canadian citizens, create more jobs, and improve international trade. Moreover, the increased investment and attention will increase our yearly GDP for the Canadian economy. In conclusion, developing our infrastructure helps grow our economy by increasing jobs, being more self-sufficient, increasing the quality of life, and boosting trade.

# Reflection 
In the writing process for the Ministry of Finance policy brief, the PEAR Tutoring Service editing tool was a great way to get feedback on what my policy brief was missing. The PEAR Tutoring Service provided prompt edits and feedback making it easier to further edit my brief, due to less of a time constraint. Although I like the service, I did not use all the feedback because I felt it did not all pertain to how a policy brief should be laid out. I found the comments on grammar very helpful and took all advice on how to fix my writing to be clearer and more accurate. As well, I found it helpful that the Tutor asked questions in the comments to help generate possible ideas for how to add more to my writing and give better explanations. Furthermore, I enjoyed the creativity of this assignment because of the wide variety of topics to choose from and the freedom to make the layout more eye-catching. Overall, I enjoyed writing this assignment I found researching was very informative and gave me and better perspective of how Canada’s economy is budgeted.
