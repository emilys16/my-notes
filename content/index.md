Welcome to my University of Guelph portfolio. Here you will find projects from business, technology, culture, and creative courses.

My name is Emily Scott and I am a third year Bcom Management student at the University of Guelph. In my free time I like to bake pastries and read classics. Please feel free to explore my different projects across my culture, technology, and business courses!
